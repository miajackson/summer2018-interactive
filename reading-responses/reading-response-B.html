    <h2>Reading Response B: </h2>
    <hr>
    <h4> Question 1: In the, "I am a Handle" reading, he poses the question: "Did we distinguish between 'real' and 'virtual' things <br>
    before the computer came along?" My question is do people think the term "virtual" has changed meanings since the start of the
    the internet, and in what ways are basic terms that have <br>existed before in someway altered with the rise of new technology and inventions <br>
    are created (similarly to the way that the meaning symbol and logo have become interchangeable as mentioned in the "See How you Feel" reading"? </h4>

    <h4> Question 2: Do you think looking at the evolution of symbols throughout history can be a valuable method for understanding people and culture?</h4>
