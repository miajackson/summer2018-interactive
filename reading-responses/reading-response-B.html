    <h2>Reading Response B: </h2>
    <hr>
    <h1> In the "I ama Handle" reading, he poses the question: "Did we distinguish between 'real' and 'virtual' things <br>
    before the computer came along?" My question is Do people the term "virtual" has changed meanings since the start of the<br>
    the internet, and in what ways are basic terms that have existed before in someway altered once new technology and inventions <br>
    are created? </h1>
    <p>I agree with this quote because computers have become so common-place and <br>necessary in our daily lives that we oftentimes forget home much power our <br>computer can actually hold and how much people’s lives have changed since<br> the computer has been interwoven into society. We forget that most of <br>our parents did not even have a computer at home when we were <br>young yet now our computers fit in our back pockets.
    <br><br>
    Also, he at first says “when we use computers too much’ then corrects himself by sayin <br> “a typical amount” which to me reflects the fact that we are constantly using <br>computers throughout our lives (with our phones, laptops, watches etc) to a point <br> that this excess use is not excess anymore.
