    <h2>Reading Response A: What is Code?</h2>
    <hr>
    <h1> "When you use computers too much—which is to say a typical amount—they start to change you.”</h1>
    <p>I agree with this quote because computers have become so common-place and <br>necessary in our daily lives that we oftentimes forget home much power our <br>computer can actually hold and how much people’s lives have changed since<br> the computer has been interwoven into society. We forget that most of <br>our parents did not even have a computer at home when we were <br>young yet now our computers fit in our back pockets.
    <br><br>
    Also, he at first says “when we use computers too much’ then corrects himself by sayin <br> “a typical amount” which to me reflects the fact that we are constantly using <br>computers throughout our lives (with our phones, laptops, watches etc) to a point <br> that this excess use is not excess anymore.
