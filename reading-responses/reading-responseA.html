    <h2>Reading Response A: What is Code?</h2>
    <hr>
    <h1> "When you use computers too much—which is to say a typical amount—they start to change you.”</h1>
    <p>I agree with this quote because computers have become so common-place and necessary in our daily lives that we oftentimes forget home much power our computer can actually hold and how much people’s lives have changed since the computer has been interwoven into society. We forget that most of our parents did not even have a computer at home when we were young yet now our computers fit in our back pockets.

    Also, he at first says “when we use computers too much’ then corrects himself by saying “a typical amount” which to me reflects the fact that we are constantly using computers throughout our lives (with our phones, laptops, watches etc) to a point that this excess use is not excess anymore.
