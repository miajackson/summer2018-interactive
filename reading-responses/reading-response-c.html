    <h3>Reading Response C:</h3>

    <h4> "A collection is usually an attempt to someone take hold of the world
    around us, to control atleast a few of its parts." </h4>

    <h5> I thought this quote introduced an interesting way to think about the <br>
    relationship between the world and specifically between an artist/designer <br>
    and their work and the ways in which this reflects life. If you think about <br>
    A collection as an attempt to take hold of the world, then I think its acceptable <br>
    to say that an artist work is perhaps a reflection of what they do not yet have hold <br>
    of or of what they would like to obtain a clearer viewpoint about. </h5>
