    The first passport was accredited to King Henry V of England, but they
    were not widely used until right after WW1, in 1918<br>

    Each country, in addition to some individual cities within the country have
    their own stamp. So, depending on the origin of the stamp, it may reveal not
    only the country, but also the city within the country. The appearance of the
    stamps depends on the country you are in.<br>

    Entrance and exit stamps.

    Looking through old passports can allow you to look at old memories.
